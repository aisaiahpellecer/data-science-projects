# Aisaiah Pellecer - Data Analysis/ Data Science Portfolio
## About
***
Hello, I'm Aisaiah Pellecer! I am an Information Sciences (B.S) student at the university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I focuse on their data science pathway. I am really interested in data science and opportunties within the field. This past summer(2022), I had the opportunity to work at [MAPSCorps](https://mapscorps.org/) as a data coordinator. Under this position I was able to work with South Shore Works, a community-based organization, and construct a data-driven policy repsonse using City of Chicago data and MAPSCorps community asset database. At the end of the summer my team and I presented our reponse at the MAPSCorps Scientific Symposium and we were selected as the best team, winning the data driven community-advocacy award ($10K scholarship!). In addition to my experience at MAPSCorps I was a LÃ­deres Avanzado Fellow at [UnidosUS, the nation's largest civil right organization](https://www.unidosus.org/). From my experiences I understand how important Data Sciecne is to our society  and I am eager to learn more!

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
